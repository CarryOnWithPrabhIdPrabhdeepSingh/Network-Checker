# INTRODUCTION
This is a simple Network Checker that i made using python, it can check if you are connected to the network or not.

# HOW IT WORKS
First it tries to open any random URL, the Website does not open if the network is not working, and gives an error, if the error is connection error or timeout error, that means you are not connected to the network and returns that "you are not connected to the network", else, if it can open the website, it returns "You are connected to the network", The program does not crash even with an error because i used the try and except block.

# By The Way
